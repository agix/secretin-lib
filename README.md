![Jacques Secr√©tin](http://www.echo62.com/images/sportif/sportif48.jpg)

Open source secret manager with groups managment based on webapi crypto http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/

**No dependencies**, only "vanilla" JS

Exists in two versions :
* Standalone (you have to copy paste your json DB)
* Server saved (CouchDB save your encrypted DB)

# Install
## Standalone
You can download server/client/secretinAlone.tar.gz (https://www.secret-in.me/secretinAlone.tar.gz)
```
wget https://www.secret-in.me/secretinAlone.tar.gz
tar xvzf secretinAlone.tar.gz
cd alone
google-chrome index.html
```

## Specific pre logon windows hooking
Step to install is not written yet but here is the result :

## Server saved
You need to install couchDB and redis on your server.

You can download last dist version secretin.tar.gz
```
tar xvzf secretin.tar.gz
npm install
node install.js
node index.js
```

install.js is just for _design creation in couchDB.

Application listen on localhost port 3000 and should be used with reverse proxy !

**nginx configuration example**
```
server {
    listen      443;
    server_name *.secret-in.me;
    ssl on;
    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/tls/secret-in.me.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/tls/secret-in.me.key;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2;
    ssl_ciphers 'AES256+EECDH:AES256+EDH';
    ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/tls/dhparam.pem;
    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;

    charset     utf-8;

    client_max_body_size 512M;

    location / {
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
    }

}
```

**init.d script example**
```
#! /bin/sh -e

DAEMON_DIR="/home/secretin/server/"
DAEMON_LOGDIR="/home/secretin/"
DAEMON_UID="secretin"
DAEMON_NAME="secretin"

case "$1" in
  start)
  echo "Starting $DAEMON_NAME..."
  sudo -H -u secretin forever start --sourceDir=$DAEMON_DIR --workingDir=$DAEMON_DIR -a -o $DAEMON_LOGDIR"access.log" -e $DAEMON_LOGDIR"error.log" --uid $DAEMON_UID index.js
  ;;

  stop)
  echo "Stoping $DAEMON_NAME..."
  sudo -H -u secretin forever stop $DAEMON_UID
  ;;

  *)
  echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/$DAEMON_NAME {start|stop}"
  exit 1
  ;;
esac

exit 0
```

## Build yourself
You need to install gulp

```
npm install
gulp &
google-chrome dist/index.html
```

You can use `gulp deploy` to create tar.gz archives (secretin.tar.gz for server version and server/client/secretinAlone.tar.gz for stand alone)

# How it works
## Introduction
Secret-in first aim is to remove any centralised obscur point.
* You can read the whole source code
* No monster libraries included (Jquery I'm looking at you)
* No server confidentiality needs
* Crypto is not part of this code

The only thing you are forced to trust is your browser (and I hope you do because it's difficult to do without). We hope http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/ is well designed in your modern browser and are not responsible for bad cryptography implementation (as we are not crypto expert at all)

Another point secret-in is trying to handle is secrets sharing.

The whole things try to respect maximum anonymity. We want database leakage to be a feature so no datas should be usable without your keys (not even metadata like username or secret title).
## Details
This part try to explain the whole operation behind secret-in.

First, you need username and master password.

When you create a new account, username is SHA256'ed and a RSA-OAEP key pair is generated (according to http://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/#algorithm-overview array, RSA-OAEP seems to be the only assymetric algorithm that support encrypt and decrypt method)

Then your private key is wrapped with AES-CBC-256 and a derivedKey from your master password.

The derivedKey use PBKDF2 with SHA-256, 256 bits random salt and 100 000 + (random%255) iterations.

When you create a secret, you give a title and a secret content.

The title is salted with the timestamp then SHA256'ed to serve as an ID.

The secret is encrypted using AES-GCM-256 with randomly generated intermediate key.

Finally, this intermediate key is wrapped with your public key and linked with the hashed title.

Another layer of authentication is added on server side. The derived key is SHA256'ed and sent to the server that compare the SHA256 of it with the hash it saved when you created your account.

This way the key is hard to BF, doesn't travel in clear on the wires and are not known by the server.

Any time you want to access a secret, you need to type your master password that would decrypt your private key that would decrypt the intermediate key that would decrypt the secret.

Using this, it's easy to share secret. You need to know the exact username of your friend so you can find his public key to encrypt the intermediate key of the secret.

Another field (named metadatas) is encrypted with the same intermediate key and contains the title and the list of users which can access the secret.

Every metadatas fields are decrypted after login to be able to generate the list of secret.

Secret field is only decrypted when you try to access the secret (unshare modify the intermediate key so it needs to decrypt the secret to reencrypt it with the new intermediate key).

In server saved mode every modification requests use challenge to prove user has rights to do the modification. It's a simple random token encrypted with claimed user public key.

## "API"

User object has username, publicKey, privateKey, keys, metadatas and token attributes.
It takes username string as creation argument.
* *generateMasterKey* generate new key pair and populate publicKey and privateKey.
  * it returns nothing

### SAVE API
API object takes server url for server saved version and `{users: {}, secrets: {}}` for standalone version.
* *userExists* takes username string or hashedUsername hexString as argument plus an argument to say if it's hashed.
  * it returns true or false if user exists or not.
* *addUser* takes username string, `{privateKey: hexString, iv: hexString}` object, jwk publicKey object and `{salt: hexString, hash: hexString}` arguments. It adds the user to the DB (the hash is SHA256'ed on the DB).
  * it returns nothing.
* *addSecret* takes user object and `{secret: hexString, iv: hexString, wrappedKey: hexString, encryptedTitle: hexString, hashedUsername: hexString, hashedTitle: hexString}` object argument. It adds the secret to the DB using challenge to authenticate the user.

  * it returns nothing
* *unshareSecret* takes user object, friendName string, hashedTitle hexString and hashedFriendName hexString. It unshares secret for friendName using challenge to authenticate the user. Be careful, it doesn't renew the intermediate keys for the other.
  * it returns nothing
* *newKey* takes user object, hashedTitle hexString, `{secret: hexString, iv: hexString}` object and array of `{user: hexString, key: hexString}` objects arguments. It's used when intermediate key is changed (when secret unsharing for example) and use challenge to authenticate the user.
  * it returns nothing
* *shareSecret* takes user object, `{wrappedKey: hexString, encryptedTitle: hexString, friendName: hexString}` object, hashedTitle hexString and rights (0=read, 1=+write, 2=+share) arguments. It shares secret with friendName using challenge to authenticate the user.
  * it returns nothing
* *getPublicKey* takes username string or username hexString and boolean to say if it's hashed in arguments.

  * it returns `{privateKey: hexString, iv: hexString}` object
* *getDerivationParameters* takes username string or username hexString and boolean to say if it's hashed in arguments.
  * it returns `{salt: hexString, iterations: int}`.
* *getKeys* takes username string or username hexString, derived key hash hexString  and boolean to say if it's hashed in arguments.
  * it returns list of `{hashedTitle: {title: hexString, key: hexString, right: int}}`
* *getUser* takes username string or username hexString, derived key hash hexString  and boolean to say if it's hashed in arguments. It's like getPublicKey, getWrappedPrivateKey, getKeys and getSalt combined.
  * it returns `{privateKey: {privateKey: hexString, iv: hexString}, publicKey: jwkObject, keys: {hashedTitle01: {title: hexString, key: hexString, right: int}}}`
* *getSecret* it takes hashedTitle hexString argument.
  * it returns secret hexString
* *changePassword* takes user object and `{privateKey: {privateKey: hexString, iv: hexString}` arguments. It changes the master password that wraps the privateKey using challenge to authenticate the user.
  * it returns nothing
* *getDB* takes username string or username hexString, derived key hash hexString and boolean to say if it's hashed in arguments.
  * it returns the whole database used by username.
